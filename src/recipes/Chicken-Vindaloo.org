** Ingredients

*** Vindaloo Paste

- To blend
- 1½ tablespoons coriander seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 10 pepper corn
- 2 inches cinnamon
- 4 cloves
- 2 green cardamoms (optional)
- ½ teaspoon mustard seeds
- 20 dried red chilies (less spicy kind) or 1 tablespoon chilli powder (notes 1)
- 3 tablespoons vinegar (malt/goan/red wine vinegar) (notes 2)
- 10 garlic cloves (25 grams)
- 1½ inch ginger (25 grams)

*** Chicken Vindaloo

- 2 lbs bone-in chicken (800 grams to 1 kg or 1.5 lbs. boneless chicken)
- ½ teaspoon turmeric
- ¾ to 1 teaspoon salt (I used ¾ tsp pink salt)
- 3 tablespoons oil (I used coconut oil)
- 2 onions (optional) (ﬁne chopped or processed)
- 2 tomatoes (optional) (pureed)
- 1 tablespoon vinegar (malt/goan/red wine vinegar) (notes 2)
- 1 teaspoon sugar (notes 3)
- ¼ to ½ cup hot water (refer notes)


** Directions
*** Day Before
1. Deseed red chilies and soak them in 3 tbsps vinegar and 3 tbsps hot water. Set
aside.
2. Add coriander seeds, cumin, pepper corn, mustard, cinnamon, cloves and
cardamoms to a blender jar.
3. Make a ﬁne powder. Then add ginger garlic and soaked red chilies.
4. Add the vinegar water mixture and make a smooth paste.
5. Next add this to the cleaned chicken along with turmeric and salt.
6. Marinate and rest aside for at least an hour to overnight in refrigerator to absorb the
ﬂavors.
*** Cooking the Chicken Vendaloo
1. Heat oil in a deep pot and saute the onions (optional) until golden to light brown.
2. Add 1 tbsp vinegar & 1 tsp sugar to the onions.
3. Then add the marinated chicken and saute for 3 to 5 mins on a medium heat.
4. Pour the tomato puree (optional) and continue to saute for another 3 to 4 mins.
5. If your chicken lets out lots of moisture, do not add water. Mine did not so I poured
half cup hot water. If you prefer a dry curry then skip adding water. The chicken will
cook in its own moisture.
6. Cover and simmer until the chicken cooked through & fork tender.
7. To check if the meat is done, prick it with a fork. The meat should fall oﬀ the bone
easily.
8. Simmer until the gravy reaches a thick & semi dry stage. Taste and add more salt if
needed.
9. Serve chicken vindaloo with plain rice or naan.
